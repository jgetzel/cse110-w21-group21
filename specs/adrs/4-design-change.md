## Context and Problem Statement

Our old pomodoro app interface was quite bland, we felt that not all users would have liked such a plain aethetic and that there might be other ways to help provide a smooth, calming and non-distracting experience to users.

## Considered Options

### Keep Current Design

- Outright very simple, some people might like it, some people might think it's too boring
- Less work is needed, we won't need to change any of our current CSS at all

### Using a new design that incorporates a nature aesthetitc

- Makes the pomodoro app look a lot more aesthetic and adds more color to our previously bland app
- Using real life images can be more calming than plain white as it is more natural.
- The background can also be used to match the time of day, which can provide a better overall, soothing, and less distracting experience to users who are focusing
- Will require a bit of time to add new CSS for this new design

### Same overall design, but potentially different color scheme and using more colors throughout

- A different color scheme could be good however our logo is that of a tomato and it wouldn't really make much sense to use a theme that does not incorporate some kind of red
- Using more colors can potentially make our app more interesting, flamboyant, and attract users.
- However, more colors can also be a distraction if theyre too bright

## Decision Outcome

We ultimately decided to use a nature centric aesthetic as at first glance it does not seem like it'll take too much extra time to implement. Moreover, we thought that the natural feeling evoked by such an aesthetic not only makes the app more appealing but helps keep our users focused, which is one of our primary goals. Additionally, we were inspired to choose this option because of websites like bing.com that use natural images as the background which we thought was really appealing.

While we could use more colors instead of nature centric aesthetic, we thought that it would be better to have "more colors" via real life images instead of picking our own color pallete and painting it everywhere on the app.
