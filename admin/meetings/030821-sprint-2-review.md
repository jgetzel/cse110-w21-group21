### Progress this sprint
- We updated the stats to properly reflect the data that was stored in local storage
  - Tasks are currently stored in a new "pomo session" class that handles things such as incrementing pomos, sotring the current time, the task associated with that session, and more.
- Complete redesign has taken place to implement our new "natural aesthetic" design.
- We have included webpack/babel integration into our project
- Input component bug-fixes
  - Timer no longer starts if there are no tasks in the current session
- We can now restore the session state if the page is refreshed (i.e if you are in break time, and you refresh the page, you will still be in break time).
- There are CSS transitions now
  - Fading in upon loading, completed tasks fading out, etc.
- Worked as a team and cherished each other's company
