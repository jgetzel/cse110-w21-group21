# Kickoff (Part 2)

### Attendance:
- Jakob
- Shwet
- Manav
- Stone
- Ethan
- Xiaolong

Decisions Made:
- When we are coding everything, we have a development branch that we will work on. At the end of the weeks development, we will merge that branch, and github actions will do a whole of checks to make sure everything is ok before the merge is approved
- We will add github actions to every merge on both main and the dev-branch.
- The current plan is to first implement the timer with mostly black and white design.
- First thing on the list of things to do is to create the first page.
- We will no longer be committing directly to main. We will have a dev-branch that we will merge to, and then merge that to main at the end of every week. This includes documentation.
- Github will no longer be running checks to verify merges onto main, instead we will have the pull request need to be reviewed by another person.
- Next meeting, Jakob Getzel, will be responsible for adding code coverage to the repo.
