# Creating Templates

### Attendance:

- Xiaolong
- Kevin

Decisions Made:
- All the components will be based on the template created by Stone.
- Style sheets to go in assets/styles
- Tried to work on component based testing
- Each person must write his own tests (once we figure out how to do it properly ofc)

To Do:
- Everyone to work on their assigned tasks
- Need to figure out a way to do component based testing
