This session, we focused on making a flowchart to more easily understand the application we will be designing.


### Decisions Made:
- We will no longer be allocating Pomodoros at the beginning of the planning session
- Instead, the user will simply start by adding tasks, and allocate pomodoros accordingly.
- During the timer, the user will be able to switch/choose which task they would like to work on
- During the break, the user can add new tasks during the session
- We decided to add a history page which can be accessed upon entering the site

### Exploratory Coding
- Prototype timer made to understand principles behind making a timer with HTML + CSS + JS.
- Code shared with team so we understand how a timer might be implemented.
