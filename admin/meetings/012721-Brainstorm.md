## Brainstorm Meeting
### Present:
- Jakob Getzel
- Shwet Chitnis
- Xiaolong Huang
- Manav Ram
- Ethan Huynh

### Agenda:
- Find a general direction for our project
- Learn principles of the Pomo timer
- Decide how we might implement these principles in our own timer

### Decisions Made:
- General Design Decisions for the Pomo Timer
  - Begin by choosing number of POMOs in your total work session
  - After that, create tasks which you allocate your POMOs to (and their expected time)
  - Allow for some "ready button in which they are switched to a "Pre-Timer" state
  - Display the Timer and task before starting, as well as start button
  - Allow user to select different tasks, or go back to schedule, before starting
  - During the timer, have a stop button that breaks the session, move the timer as to not be distracting, and allow the user to record distracting thoughts
  - Allow the user to select different tasks while that's happening
  - Display the current task
  - After task is done, if task out of order was chosen, go back to original task order
  - After the timer is up, we would start the break
  - Also play SFX as to notify the user if they are in another window.
  - At the end of all tasks, or the end of the last Pomo timer, visualize our progress
  - We will currently focus on making our app on the website.
  - As a bonus, we added extra plans for if we get all of this done early. This includes
    - Correct Allocation of pomos. The current allocation scheme involves only counting the pomo that was complete when the timer ended. We would fix that to make it a more accurate representation of which task was worked on the most
    - Better SFX
    - Spend more time on visuals
    - Experiment with different timer design schemes (designed for minimalism and non-intrusiveness)

### Future Plans:
  - Planned future meeting for brainstorm pt II
  - Work on a flow chart for Pomodoro app, making a simple diagram of our system.
