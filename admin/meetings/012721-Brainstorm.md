## Brainstorm Meeting
### Present:
- Jakob Getzel
- Shwet Chitnis
- Xiaolong Huang
- Manav Ram
- Ethan Huynh

### Agenda:
- Find a general direction for our project
- Learn principles of the Pomo timer
- Decide how we might implement these principles in our own timer

### Decisions Made:
- General Design Decisions for the Pomo Timer
  - Begin by choosing number of POMOs in your total work session
  - After that, create tasks which you allocate your POMOs to (and their expected time)
  - Allow for some "ready button in which they are switched to a "Pre-Timer" state
  - Display the Timer and task before starting, as well as start button
  - Allow user to select different tasks, or go back to schedule, before starting
  - During the timer, have a stop button that breaks the session, move the timer as to not be distracting, and allow the user to record distracting thoughts
  - Allow the user to select differnt tasks while that's happening
  - Display the current task
  - 

### Future Plans:
  - Planned future meeting for brainstorm pt II
