# Meeting Notes
---

### Attendance:
- Shwet
- Manav
- Ethan
- Xiaolong
- Kevin
- Jakob


### Decisions Made:
- Instead of manually assigning next task/ending Pomo early once task ends, they organize tasks in the order that they actually wanted to execute them in. 
Once they are in the middle of the Pomo, all they would have is the task name, the timer/visual design showing how much time is left, and the complete task button.
Once the button is pressed, they move to the task next in the order that they already chose.
- Have break window that actually has a large timer in a middle, that allows much more interaction that we would have in the main window.
Some things you could do would be to allow the user to change the order of the tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed if you didn't hit the button during the session.
