### Decisions Made:
- During the timer, the POMO will be in the top right
- Task list will be in the center.
- Have a list of every single task, and the number of pomos allocated to each Pomo at the end
- It is possible for not all tasks to be completed. When this happens, we can represent the uncompleted tasks in the end screen.
- History tab:
  - Possible Daily/Weekly line graph representing:
    - Pomos Completed
    - Extra Pomos used
    - Pomos missed
    - Tasks Completed overall
    - Tasks completed on time
    - Tasks not completed in time
- You can access the history tab at the top right of the site
- The history tab is not accessible once the timer is running. 
- The daily view will show your current progress for the day, while the weekly view will show your progress over the course of the week.
- Daily view will use a bar graph to compare completed tasks, to underestimated tasks, to uncompleted tasks.
